# TV Commercial Classification Challenge

This challenge aims to classify TV news videos into two categories: commercials and non-commercials. Commercial blocks in news videos occupy almost 40-60% of total air time. The manual segmentation of commercials from thousands of TV news channels is time-consuming and economically infeasible. Hence, the need for machine learning-based methods arises. This challenge provides a dataset consisting of 150 hours of broadcast news videos from 5 different news channels, including 3 Indian and 2 international channels.

## Objective

Given the audio-visual features extracted from each video shot, the objective is to classify each shot as a commercial or a non-commercial. This is a semantic video classification problem.

The evaluation metric for this challenge is the AUC.
